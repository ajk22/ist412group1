Extra requirement for submission: 
Please include a README_USECASE1.txt file in your project submission.  
Inside this file write a short paragraph/few sentences that:
-explains at a high level what your use case is and 
-what your software should be able to accomplish with your completed use case.  

The first use case our group has done for this assingment is the park Information.
Firstly, users need to type in correct account and password if they already have accounts.
Otherwise, they need to sign up an new account. Once they log in successfully, the main menu 
will be displayed by contoller, and users can choose one buttom from the main menu. If users
want to learn some information about each park, including attractions, restaurants, shops, 
rides and their business hours, they can click the park information buttom. After users push the 
park information buttom, they need to pick one park first, and then, they can easily browse all 
basic information of that park. Additionally, all information is classified into attractions, 
restaurants, shop, and rides, so users can check details of anything that they are looking for,
 and the reset buttom is also created for users to refresh the page.
