M03-A03 Implemented Design Patterns:

Object Oriented Pattern:
    -Iterator
    -Package: Engine
    -Classes: engine, controller
    -Other classes affected (to String): admin, attraction, 
    event, restaurant, ride, shop, user, vacationer, worker
    -Comments: This Iterator pattern reads and iterates through the data files
    in order to correctly identify the proper object to create, and then add
    that specific object to either the user list or attraction list
